<h1>Consultations</h1>
<p>In-depth consultations are typically the best way to address overall health needs. Fatigue, hormone imbalance, digestive concerns, and many other issues are often related and can be simplified by understanding how they are connected to each other. If you do not feel your best but have been unable to find answers, scheduling a comprehensive consultation can be the most cost-effective way to arrive at solutions that make a difference as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Prior to your first comprehensive appointment, Dr. Davies will review the symptoms and concerns you may have, as well as any previous relevant lab work you might provide.</p>
<p>Your first visit will typically include a 45-minute video or in-person consultation, and we will go over your concerns thoroughly, quickly review any labs you may have provided, discuss nutrition and supplementation, and start integrating a functional plan to address the root causes of your health concerns.</p>
<p>Follow up appointments are either 30 or 45 minutes depending on how you are doing and what we will be going over. Our goal is to work together to establish an effective plan where you begin to see results as quickly as possible, so that as few visits as possible are needed in to address your concerns.</p>
