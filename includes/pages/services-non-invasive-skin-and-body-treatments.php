<h1>Non-Invasive Skin and Body Treatments</h1>
<p>We offer non-invasive skin tightening procedures to stimulate, restore, and maintain your natural collagen production. Collagen is the main structural protein found in skin and other connective tissues. As you age, your body starts producing less collagen. The skin becomes thinner, drier, and less elastic. The loss of collagen leads to wrinkle formation.</p>
<p>Age-related skin changes are natural. After age 20, we begin to lose as much as 1% to 2% of skin elasticity. Most people will notice a significant change in their skinâ€™s elasticity by 35 years old.</p>
